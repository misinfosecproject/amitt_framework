# AMITT Framework - now in AMITT

The new repo for all AMITT TTPs - for both disinformation creators and defenders - is [AMITT](https://github.com/cogsec-collaborative/AMITT). 

The new repo contains all the data and code from the AMITT_framework repo and AMITT_Counters repo, and is being updated and maintained by [CogSecCollab](http://cogsec-collab.org/).

This repo has been left here to mark our history, and so people can find the new work.
